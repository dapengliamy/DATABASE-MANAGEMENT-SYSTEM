**Result**

The score for the neural network regression model is 73.3% which is better than the linear regression model(69.9%). Predict_combine.csv shows part of our result of the predicted data. The left column shows the pre- dicted price of the linear regression model, the right column shows the predicted price of the neural network regression model and the middle column shows the true predicated price. This table clearly demonstrates the more accuracy neural network models achieved in predicating the price compared to the linear regression model.
